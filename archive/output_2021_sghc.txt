42: (7 of each BPO explicitly provided that POA, 'Clause 7 of each BPO explicitly provided that POA could allocate the Investors’ monies “for development and purchase of oil and gas leases/assets”.')
 ----------
43: (POA, 'Thus, even if the Investors’ moneys had been used to purchase oil and gas assets instead of crude oil, this was a legitimate means of raising money to fulfil POA’s contract obligations, and is not evidence of fraud per se.')

 ----------
50: (POA, 'The defendants demur that they had used whatever information they had been given by POA and COGI without embellishment, and had represented accurately what they were told.')
 ----------
51: (POA, 'The only remaining criticism one might possibly make is that POA had dressed up the BPOs as contracts for the purchase of crude oil when they were in fact a little more sophisticated, namely, contracts that are more like investments in the commercial ventures of POA in which POA promises to reward the investors with a return of 12% per annum.')
 ----------
52: (POA, 'There is also evidence from the email of Alex Gramatzki (the Vice-President of POA at the material time) that shows that the Canadians were trying to control the damage without alarming the Investors, but eventually, the loss was too great and nothing could be done but for everyone to roll over and give up — except for Li and Luong whose story I now proceed to narrate.')
 ----------
53: (POA, 'Li and Luong, and perhaps a couple of the other members of the Interim Advisory Board, after gaining control of CAGOM Canada, sold off a valuable POA asset known as the ‘Joffre’ asset without the requisite 60% shareholders’ approval, and in spite of express objections to the sale.')

 ----------
56: (POA, 'Based on the above, it is obvious to me that any action which Li and Luong had carried out to recover POA’s assets was undertaken purely for their own benefit (for they, as well as their principals, were major investors in the scheme).')
 ----------
57: (POA, 'They also had the novel idea of shielding themselves from potential loss through the payment of party and party costs by herding the Investors into POA Recovery Pte Ltd — the S$1 plaintiff company — to sue the defendants.')

On the same day (27 February 2020), TPL paid the down-payment of $50,000. TPL did not pay any of the subsequent monthly instalments. However, on 21 March 2020, TPL paid AEPL $10,000 and sometime later, TPL gave AEPL a cheque for $490,000, post-dated to 30 June 2020. AEPL presented the cheque for payment on 30 June 2020; the cheque was dishonoured because TPL had stopped payment on the cheque. The circumstances surrounding the payment of $10,000 and the issuance of the cheque were in dispute. On 31 August 2020, TPL commenced DC 2021 against AEPL, alleging fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of the Agreement, among other things. The principal relief sought by TPL was payment of a sum of $123,140.22 (which included the payments of $50,000 and $10,000 that TPL had made). On 28 September 2020, AEPL filed its defence and counterclaim.

 ----------

 ----------
28: (82A of the LPA, 'I note that the issue of the Law Society’s standing to make an application under s 82A of the LPA was not raised in these authorities, but that suggests that it was perhaps not thought to be a point worth taking.')

 ----------
205: (CPC, 'However, as we have explained, the real point of the Broad Interpretation is not to govern the conduct of other proceedings, but rather to restrict the use of statements obtained by the exercise of coercive powers found in the CPC.')
 ----------
206: (CPC, 'Otherwise the very mischief identified by the AGC and the applicant would arise in a different context: that the fruit of the powers conferred exclusively for the purposes of the CPC would be capable of being used in other types of proceedings when such use was never contemplated under the CPC itself.')

225: (259 of the CPC, 'If, however, we had to consider the applicability of ss 258 and 259 of the CPC, it seems to us that the position is somewhat nuanced.')
 ----------
226: (258 of the CPC, 'In our view, s 258 of the CPC does not apply to that statement because the present OS simply does not involve criminal proceedings against Ng himself.')

 ----------
228: (259 of the CPC, 'Nevertheless, it seems to us that Ng’s Further Statement remains outside the ambit of s 259 of the CPC because it had been recorded in the course of investigations in relation to a criminal offence that Ng had been tried for.')
