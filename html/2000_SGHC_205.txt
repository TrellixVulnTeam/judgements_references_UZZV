This is an application filed on 2 June 2000 by Manjit Kaur Monica (‘the Applicant’) seeking to set aside a Statutory Demand dated 17 February 2000 issued by the solicitors of the Respondents, Standard Chartered Bank (‘the Bank’) and to dismiss the Bank’s Creditor’s Petition No 1020/2000 dated 19 April 2000 filed against her. ‘RE: Buyer for No. 197, Yio Chu Kang Road Dear Sir/Madam, This is to (sic) request that we have a buyer for the above property at $550,000. For the short fall of approximately $427,000 we are willing to sign a term loan of 10 years. We are able to afford the instalments of $5000 per month. I can pay $5000 on the 28th January 99. I will also be able to get one or two (sic) guarantor to support the loan. Looking forward to an early reply via fax No. 2241814.’ ‘CLAIM BY STANDARD CHARTERED BANK Housing Loan No. 00382833 Current No. 02-028-65738 We (sic) receive your letter on the 13th November 1999. My husband Jeswindar Singh is requesting a grace period of 14 days (sic) in respond to your letter of 10th November 1999. Sorry for any (sic) inconveniences caused. Yours faithfully Sg. Manjit Kaur P/S Please forward all correspondence to our office address as above. Thank You.’ ‘Dear Cheryl Lee, RE: Your Ref: WL/SCBG/045/06/97 (CH/SS) I (sic) have rung your office last week, and they say you were on leave. However this is to request if I and my husband Jeswindar Singh could come and see you personally to receive the Statutory Demand. (sic) As my Bankruptcy Proceedings will be withdrawn in about 2 to 3 weeks and I am waiting for the Court Order. So could I come and see you together with my husband after it is withdrawn. It would be easier if you could serve it on us together as it is the same case. Please let me know if this is alright. You could reply this letter to fax number 2950049. I could fix an appointment with you for 6th March 2000 at 2 p.m. as by then the Bankruptcy Proceedings will be withdrawn by then. Thank you for your co-operation. Sorry for any inconvenience caused.’ The bankruptcy proceedings referred to in the letter were probably proceedings by another creditor. (a) A valuation report by Henry Butcher Appraisal Group Pte Ltd (‘Henry Butcher’) dated 26 August 1994. This valued the Open Market Value of the Property as of that date to be $1.2 million and the Forced Sale Value to be $1.02 million. (b) A revised valuation from Henry Butcher via a letter dated 10 December 1999 valued the Open Market Value of the Property as at 1 February 1999 to be $934,000. (c) The second valuation was repeated in another letter dated 11 August 2000 from Henry Butcher reiterating the Open Market Value of the Property as at 1 February 1999 to be $934,000 but this time including a Forced Sale Value of $793,000 as at 1 February 1999. (d) Another letter also dated 11 August 2000 from Henry Butcher valuing the Open Market Value of the Property as at 1 September 1999 at $1.068 million and the Forced Sale Value as at the same date as $907,800. (e) A valuation report by Newman & Goh dated 10 January 2000 valuing the Open Market Value of the Property as at February 1999 to be $930,000 and as at September 1999 to be $1.1 million. ‘Evidence of computer output 35(1) Unless otherwise provided in any other written law, where computer output is tendered in evidence for any purpose whatsoever, such output shall be admissible if it is relevant or otherwise admissible, according to the other provisions of this Act or any other written law, and it is - (a) expressly agreed between the parties to the proceedings at any time that neither its authenticity nor the accuracy of its contents are disputed; (b) produced in an approved process; or (c) shown by the party tendering such output that - (i) there is no reasonable ground for believing that the output is inaccurate because of improper use of the computer and that no reason exists to doubt or suspect the truth or reliability of the output; and (ii) there is reasonable ground to believe that at all material times the computer was operating properly, or if not, that in any respect in which it was not operating properly or out of operation, the accuracy of the output was not affected by such circumstances.’ ‘98(2) The court shall set aside the statutory demand if - (b) the debt is disputed on grounds which appear to the court to be substantial;’ ‘(3) When the debtor (a) claims to have a counterclaim, set-off or cross demand (whether or not he could have raised it in the action or proceedings in which the judgment or order was obtained) which equals or exceeds the amount of the debt or debts specified in the statutory demand or (b) disputes the debt (not being a debt subject to a judgment or order), the Court will normally set aside the statutory demand if, in its opinion, on the evidence there is a genuine triable issue.’ ‘(1) This section applies where, on an application under section 459G, the Court is satisfied of either or both of the following: (a) that there is a genuine dispute between the company and the respondent about the existence or amount of a debt to which the demand relates; (b) that the company has an offsetting claim.’ ‘The meaning of "genuine dispute" in the context of this section is most usefully expounded in the often quoted passage from the judgment of the former chief judge of this division in judge in Eyota Pty Ltd v Hanave Pty Ltd (1994) 12 ACSR 785 at 787-8, where McLelland CJ in Eq said: It is, however, necessary to consider the meaning of the expression "genuine dispute" where it occurs in s 450H [sic]. In my opinion that expression connotes a plausible contention requiring investigation, and raises much the same sort of consideration as the "serious question to be tried" criterion which arises on an application for an interlocutory injunction or for the extension or removal of a caveat. This does not mean that the court must accept uncritically as giving rise to a genuine dispute, every statement in an affidavit "however equivocal, lacking in precision, inconsistent with undisputed contemporary documents or other statements by the same deponent, or inherently improbable in itself, it may be" not having "sufficient prima facie plausibility to merit further investigation as to [its] truth" (cf Eng Mee Yong v Letchumann [1980] AC 331 at 341), or "a patently feeble legal argument or an assertion of facts unsupported by evidence’: cf South Australia v Wall (1980) 24 SASR 189 at 194. But it does mean that, except in such an extreme case, a court required to determine whether there is a genuine dispute should not embark upon an inquiry as to the credit of a witness or a deponent whose evidence is relied on as giving rise to the dispute. There is a clear difference between, on the one hand, determining whether there is a genuine dispute and, on the other hand, determining the merits of, or resolving, such a dispute. In Mibor Investments (at 366-7) Hayne J said, after referring to the state of the law prior to the enactment of Div 3 of Pt 5.4 of the Corporations Law, and to the terms of Div 3: "These matters, taken in combination, suggest that at least in most cases, it is not expected that the court will embark upon any extended inquiry in order to determine whether there is a genuine dispute between the parties and certainly will not attempt to weigh the merits of that dispute. All that the legislation requires is that the court conclude that there is a dispute and that it is a genuine dispute." In Re Morris Catering (Aust) Pty Ltd (1993) 11 ACSR 601 at 605 Thomas J said: "There is little doubt that Div 3 … prescribes a formula that requires the court to assess the position between the parties, and preserve demands where it can be seen that there is no genuine dispute and no sufficient genuine offsetting claim. That is not to say that the court will examine the merits or settle the dispute. The specified limits of the court’s examination are the ascertainment of whether there is a ‘genuine dispute’ and whether there is a ‘genuine claim’. It is often possible to discern the spurious, and to identify mere bluster or assertion. But beyond a perception of genuineness (or the lack of it), the court has no function. It is not helpful to perceive that one party is more likely than the other to succeed, or that the eventual state of the account between the parties is more likely to be one result than another. The essential task is relatively simple - to identify the genuine level of a claim (not the likely result of it) and to identify the genuine level of an offsetting claim (not the likely result of it)."  I respectfully agree with those statements.’ ‘32. Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is dead or who cannot be found, or who has become incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured without an amount of delay or expense which under the circumstances of the case appears to the court unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the following cases: (c) when the statement was made by such person in the ordinary course of business, and in particular when it consists of any entry or memorandum made by him in books kept in the ordinary course of business or in the discharge of professional duty, or of an acknowledgment written or signed by him of the receipt of money, goods, securities or property of any kind, or of a document used in commerce, written or signed by him or of the date of a letter or other document usually dated, written or signed by him;’ (a) Knight Frank’s valuation of 29 October 1998 valuing the Property at between $450,000 to $480,000, (b) the fact that the auction on 16 December 1998 with an opening price of $700,000 received no bids, (c) the offers through Gates B. Properties and Jones Lang Wootton between 27 December 1998 and 20 January 1999 were between $585,000 to $610,000, (d) the Applicant’s own letter dated 5 January 1999, one month before the Bank’s sale, in which she requested the Bank to allow her to sell the Property at $550,000, (e) the fact that after the Applicant had been notified of the Bank’s sale and the price, she was seeking the Bank’s indulgence to pay the Shortfall by instalments, (f) the fact that the Applicant had been represented by solicitors in the earlier application by the Bank for judgment of the outstanding sum (before the sale) and possession, (g) the fact that the Applicant had all along, and even when she received the Statutory Demand (in February or March 2000) failed to lodge any protest with the Bank until the letter/fax from her new solicitors dated 31 May 2000 alleging for the very first time, sixteen months after the Bank’s sale, that the Property was sold at an undervalue. (a) the subsequent valuations of Henry Butcher i.e. after their first valuation dated 26 August 1994, were made without inspecting the Property again and were based on the Property’s condition in 1994 i.e. before the walls were torn down and the dumping of abandoned items, (b) the valuation report by Newman & Goh was irrelevant as it was based on an inspection of the external structure nine months after the Bank had sold the Property to the new owners who must have rebuilt the Property. In fact, that report mentioned that the Property was undergoing refurbishment. (a) when two of such computer records were first adduced by the Bank, the Applicant did not challenge their admissibility, and (b) on the contrary, the Applicant later challenged the Bank to produce the computer records of the other conversations that she supposedly had with other officers (see paragraph 37 of her third affidavit filed on 15 August 2000). ‘The true commercial value of a property is not what any valuer thinks it should but, but the actual price that property will fetch when it is put up for sale in the open market.’ (a) there was an auction of the Property on 16 December 1999 which did not attract a single bid at $700,000, (b) the subsequent offers through Gates B. Properties and Jones Lang Wootton were below $650,000, (c) the Applicant’s letter dated 5 January 2000 showed that she herself was trying to persuade the Bank to sell to a buyer she had secured at $550,000.
