The parties whom I shall refer to as husband and wife, were married on 4 June 1977. They have two children. On 24 November 1999 the husband petitioned for divorce in Divorce Petition No 3110 of 1999 on the ground of unreasonable behaviour. The wife filed an Answer on 27 December 1999. On 5 September 2000 the parties entered into an agreement in full and final settlement of the divorce and ancillary issues (‘the Settlement Agreement’). The husband contended that the wife subsequently repudiated the Settlement Agreement of 5 September 2000 and that he had accepted the repudiation. The wife disagreed. The husband withdrew his Petition on 11 January 2001. The wife then commenced the present divorce proceedings on 31 March 2001 based on the ground of adultery. The husband filed an Answer and Cross-Petition and the wife filed a Reply and Answer to Cross-Petition to which the husband filed a Reply to Reply and Answer to Cross-Petition. However, the wife’s petition was eventually heard on an uncontested basis on 30 November 2001, after the parties withdrew their respective Answer and Cross-Petition and Reply and Answer to Cross-Petition and all other pleadings relating to the Petition. A Decree Nisi was granted dissolving the long marriage of 24 years and the ancillaries were dealt with separately.
The hearing of the ancillaries was on 10 July 2002. The husband’s position was that he was not bound by the Settlement Agreement as the wife had repudiated it and he had accepted her repudiation. The wife’s position was that she had not repudiated the Settlement Agreement and the parties were bound by it. Also, the Settlement Agreement was just and equitable and the court should give effect to its terms.
The District Court concluded that it should have regard to the Settlement Agreement when exercising its discretion on the division of the matrimonial assets under s 112 of the Women’s Charter. The Grounds of Decision suggest that this was because it also concluded either that the wife had not repudiated the Settlement Agreement or, even if she had, the husband and the wife had nevertheless elected to proceed on the basis of the Settlement Agreement subsequently. The District Court also considered the terms of the Settlement Agreement to be just and equitable and upheld it.
The husband then appealed to the High Court and his appeal was heard by me. His contention was similar to that before the District Court: ‘(1) The Husband shall withdraw Divorce Petition No. 3119 [this should read as 3110] of 1999 and he shall allow and consent to the Wife proceeding on a Cross-Petition under Divorce Petition No. 3119 [this should also read as 3110] of 1999 to dissolve the marriage pursuant to Section 95(3)(a) of the Women’s Charter (Cap 353) on the ground of adultery committed by the Husband and that she finds it intolerable to live with him. The Wife shall withdraw her Answer filed in the said action and she shall seek the leave of the Court to perform the foregoing within 10 days of the execution of this Agreement. (2) The Husband and Wife agree that the terms and conditions as set out in this Agreement shall be incorporated into a consent order and be presented to the Subordinate Courts for its approval at the hearing of the Wife’s Divorce Petition.’ ‘We act for Mdm Irene Tan and have been instructed to take over conduct of the above matter from M/s A.Ang, Seah & Hoe. We are instructed that our client had never any intention of repudiating the said agreement and is in fact willing and ready to comply with the terms as set out in the same. We are further instructed that there was a miscommunication between our clients and her previous solicitors. We note that your client had withdrawn his Divorce Petition No. 3110 of 2000 at the last Pre-Trial Conference on 11 January 2001. Our client proposes that she now files a fresh Petition with the Court based on your client’s adultery pursuant to the terms of the said Agreement and that the ancillaries be settled by way of a consent order incorporating the terms set out in the said agreement. Please let us know if your client is agreeable to the above. Parties have spent much time and effort negotiating before reaching an agreement as stated in the said agreement. It would be a pity if matters remain unresolved. We hope your client will set aside his prejudices and give the settlement a chance to complete. We reiterate that our client is eager and most willing to proceed as per the terms of the said agreement. There is no intent on her part to repudiate.’ ‘We refer to the telephone conversation between your Ms Dorothy Chai and our Ms Wendy Maricich today. We confirm that your client will be in Singapore on 1 st June 2001 to accept service and that you will forward us the endorsed documents by 4th/5th June 2001. We also confirm that your client will not be contesting the divorce. ….’ ‘We refer to your Divorce Petition. We write to inform that we had effected service of the process papers on our client today at our office. We return herewith the Acknowledgment of service to evince the same. Further to the aforesaid, we also write to inform that our client is willing to consent to your client’s petition for divorce on the condition that she deletes line 2 to 5 of paragraph 11(b) and paragraph 11(c) of your client’s Divorce Petition. Please revert with your client’s confirmation that she is willing to do so. With reference to the ancillary issues, our client reserves his rights therein.’ ‘As the divorce is filed pursuant to an agreement between parties, we would normally advise client to consent to the deletion. However, our main concern is that there may not be enough facts for the Court to grant the Decree Nisi and the Divorce Petition may be dismissed. Under the circumstances, we feel that there should not be any deletion. You will note that in our Divorce Petition, there is not even a prayer for costs. In the interest of settling matters expeditiously, could you kindly advise your client to re-consider.’ (a) The husband had stated in his Memorandum of Appearance that he was (then) contesting the wife’s petition.
