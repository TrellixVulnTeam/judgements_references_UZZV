The plaintiff sued the defendant for his share of commission in a deal he claimed he helped to put through as broker.
The deal involved 42.1% of the shares of a Chinese company which operates a toll road in China. The shares were held by Spring Sun International Ltd (“SSI”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spring Sun Highway Ltd (“SSH”). The transaction was carried out by SSH selling all the shares of SSI, thus indirectly, the 42.1% shares of the Chinese company. The purchaser was IPCO International Ltd (“IPCO”), a Singapore listed company. The defendant was a director and the chairman of IPCO.
At the close of the plaintiff’s case, counsel for the defendant submitted that there was no case for the defendant to answer, and accepted that if the submission was made and failed, the defendant cannot enter his defence. After hearing submissions from both counsel, I dismissed the claim. The plaintiff appeals against my decision.
SSI and SSH were under the control of Chng Heng Tiu (“Chng”), an old and good friend of the plaintiff. Chng had asked the plaintiff to look for a buyer for the 42.1% shares.
The plaintiff worked on the assignment and introduced Chng to the defendant. The negotiations were carried out between Chng, the defendant, Ong Chee Hong (“Ong”) and the plaintiff.
Chng agreed on behalf of SSH to pay the plaintiff US$7.5m for his services. It was also agreed that commissions of US$15m and US$7.5m were to be paid to the defendant and Ong respectively.
The plaintiff, the defendant and Ong decided to use a company as the vehicle for receiving their commissions. The plaintiff found a shelf company for the purpose, Lotos Investments Ltd (“Lotos”) a British Virgin Islands company. While only Ong was registered as the director and shareholder of the company, it was their company.
Arrangements were then made for SSH to issue a letter to Lotos dated 1 July 1999 wherein SSH confirmed the appointment of Lotos as its broker in selling “our wholly owned subsidiary M/s Spring Sun International Ltd and/or our 42.1% interests in [the Chinese company] including shareholder’s advances and accrued interest” and agreed to pay Lotos or its nominees the commission of US$30m.
The plaintiff, the defendant and Ong took steps to record the sharing of the US$30m. A Commission Sharing Agreement was made on 30 December 1999 between them. This was typed on SSH’s letter of 1 July 1999 and it reads Commission Sharing Agreement 1. Tang Kay Heng’s group of companies US$7.5 million __ [signature] 2. Thew Ah Ba’s group of companies US$7.5 million ____ [signature] 3. Purwadi’s group of companies US$15.00 million _____ [signature]
