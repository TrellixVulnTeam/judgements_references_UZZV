The plaintiff, Mr Steven Joshua (“SJ”), one of five registered owners of 577A Sembawang Place, sought an order for the sale of the said property and for the distribution of the net sale proceeds to all the co-owners. He also sought an order that the fifth to tenth defendants vacate the premises and pay damages for ignoring his notice in February 2003 to do so. Two of the property’s co-owners, SJ’s brother-in-law and sister, Mr Isaac Benjamin and Mdm Rebekah Issac (together “Mr and Mrs Benjamin”) who are the third and fourth defendants respectively, supported his position. However, the remaining two co-owners, namely SJ’s former wife, Mrs Deborah Steven Joshua (“Mdm Joshua”), who is the first defendant, and SJ’s sister, Mdm Rachel Jacob (“Mdm Jacob”), who is the second defendant, opposed the application for the sale of the property on the ground that it is trust property that is intended to accommodate, among others, the fifth to tenth defendants. The fifth to tenth defendants filed a counterclaim with respect to their right to remain on the property by virtue of the alleged trust.
