The first, second and fifth to tenth defendants in Originating Summons No 1403 of 2002, who are members of a religious group called the “House of Israel” (“HOI”), sought leave to amend their Counterclaim against the plaintiff, Mr Steven Joshua (“SJ”), a few weeks after the conclusion of the trial. I dismissed the application and now give the reasons for my decision.
As the facts in this case have been referred to in [2004] SGHC 166 , they will only be briefly mentioned here. SJ, one of five registered owners of 577A Sembawang Place, sought, inter alia, an order for the sale of the said property. The first, second and fifth to tenth defendants (the “HOI defendants”) filed a Counterclaim in which they asserted that SJ had no right to sell the property because it is trust property that is intended to accommodate members of the HOI. They also claimed to have a share in the said property by virtue of the alleged trust. The HOI defendants’ case, as pleaded and canvassed throughout the trial, was based entirely on trust law. However, after the conclusion of the trial, their counsel, Mr Daniel John, stated in his written submissions that his clients had decided to abandon all their claims based on trust law. When Mr John was asked why his clients still claimed a beneficial interest in 577A Sembawang Place after destroying the foundation of their counterclaim by abandoning all their claims based on trust law, he thought about the matter and submitted Supplementary Closing Submissions, in which he disclosed for the first time that his clients claimed a beneficial interest in the property on the basis of estoppel.
