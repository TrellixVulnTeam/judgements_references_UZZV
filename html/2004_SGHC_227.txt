The Prosecution and the Defence agreed on the matters set out in a Statement of Agreed Facts. The Statement reads: Statement of Agreed Facts 1 On 7 Jan 2004, acting on information received, a party of CNB officers were deployed to look for the accused at the vicinity of Block 115 Yishun Ring Road. When they were at the vicinity, they saw a taxi SHA 7670 going into the carpark leading to Blocks 110 to 115 Yishun Ring Road with a passenger at the rear seat. The taxi was thereafter seen leaving the carpark of Blk 115 Yishun Ring Road without the passenger inside. 2 At about 10.15 am, the CNB officers spotted the accused standing behind Blk 115 Yishun Ring Road and using his mobile phone. The accused was at that time seen holding a red paper bag. He thereafter walked to the exercise corner near Blk 115 and sat down on a wooden chair. 3 At about 10.45 am, the accused was spotted walking to the void deck of Blk 115 carrying the red paper bag. He was then seen walking along the void deck of Blk 115 towards Blk 110 carrying a yellow paper bag in addition to the red bag. He then proceeded towards Blk 110 Yishun Ring Road and entered a provision shop there. 4 After a while, he emerged from the provision shop holding the red paper bag, the yellow paper bag and an additional white plastic bag. He was then seen standing along Yishun Ring Road waiting for a taxi. At about 11.10 am, the accused person boarded taxi SHA 3884 X which travelled along Yishun Ring Road, Yishun Avenue 2, Lentor Avenue and from there, entered the Central Expressway (“CTE”). 5 The CNB officers trailed the accused in the taxi SHA 3884 X. Subsequently, they received instructions to intercept the said taxi, and did so at the first available opportunity, when the taxi exited the CTE at about 11.30 am, long Upper Serangoon Road near Woodsville Close. 6 The accused was arrested while seated in the rear of the taxi. At the time of the arrest, the red paper bag (containing the yellow paper bag) and the white plastic bag were found beside the accused person. The CNB officers then escorted the accused in the taxi SHA 3884X to Puay Hee Avenue. 7 At Puay Hee Avenue in the taxi SHA 3884X, Senior Station Inspector Siew Lai Lone recorded a statement from the accused, in which the accused admitted ownership of red paper bag and confirmed that he was told that it contained 4 pounds of heroin.
