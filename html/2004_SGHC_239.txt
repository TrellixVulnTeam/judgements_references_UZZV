This Originating Motion concerns an application under s 21 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed) for the admission of Mr Henry Bernard Eder, a Queen’s Counsel, on an ad hoc basis to enable him to appear as counsel for Credit Lyonnais (“CL”) in Civil Appeals Nos 57 and 73 of 2004 (the “appeals”). I dismissed the application and now give the reasons for my decision.
The appeals, which were filed by CL, relate to Suit No 1175 of 2002, which was commenced by RBG Resources plc (“RBG”), an English company that was placed in compulsory liquidation. That suit was instituted pursuant to orders made in earlier interpleader proceedings for the resolution of competing proprietary and possessory claims between RBG and seven other companies, including CL, with respect to a cargo of metal in a warehouse in Singapore (the “warehouse”). Before the trial commenced, RBG reached a settlement with all defendants except the fourth defendant, who did not file a defence, and CL. As judgment in default of defence was entered against the fourth defendant, CL was the only defendant with whom RBG had to contend at the trial.
