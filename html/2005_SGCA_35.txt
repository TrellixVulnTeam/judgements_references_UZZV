This action which came on appeal before us arose out of statements made in the course of a corporate takeover. The struggle was for the control of NatSteel Ltd (“NatSteel”). Two companies, Sanion Pte Ltd (“Sanion”) and 98 Holdings Pte Ltd (“98 Holdings”), the second respondent, were the competing bidders.
Sanion was prominent businessman Mr Oei Hong Leong’s vehicle for the exercise. He is the appellant in this action. 98 Holdings was associated with another prominent businessman, Mr Ong Beng Seng. The first respondent, Mr Ban Song Long David (“Mr David Ban”) is a director of 98 Holdings, and was the source of the statements which led to the action. The statements were repeated in an article written by Ms Catherine Ong, the fourth respondent, which appeared in The Business Times (“BT”) of 4 June 2003 published by Singapore Press Holdings Ltd, the third respondent.
In 2003, NatSteel was a company ripe for a takeover. A management buyout was proposed before 98 Holdings and Sanion moved in. 98 Holdings became involved first, then Sanion made its bid. The competition between the two companies caused 98 Holdings to increase its offer price four times, and to extend the closing date of its offer six times. Ultimately, it acquired 51.23% of NatSteel’s shares, and gained control of the company while Sanion acquired 29.99% of the shares and became NatSteel’s largest minority shareholder.
