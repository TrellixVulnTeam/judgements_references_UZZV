In this originating summons, Ng Huat Foundations Pte Ltd (“the applicant”) applied under s 210 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) for an order that it be at liberty to convene a meeting for the purpose of considering a scheme of arrangement proposed by the applicant to its creditors. The applicant also asked for an order, which is usual in such applications, that no proceedings in any action be taken against it or continued from the date of the order to be made until the holding of the meeting of the creditors pursuant to s 210(1) of the Act. At the conclusion of the hearing, I dismissed the application with costs fixed at $750 each for the two creditors which had appeared at the hearing to oppose the application. I understand that the applicant has been wound up on 25 February 2005. Brief grounds are nevertheless set out.
The applicant was incorporated in Singapore in 1995 with a paid-up capital of $80,000.
