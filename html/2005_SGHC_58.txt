The plaintiff, SM Integrated Transware Pte Ltd (“SMI”), has brought this action against the defendant, Schenker Singapore (Pte) Ltd (“Schenker”), to recover damages it claims it has incurred by reason of Schenker’s failure to take up a lease of a warehouse at 7 Kwong Min Road, Singapore (“the warehouse”). Schenker denies that there was any concluded lease for the warehouse so as to render it liable in damages to SMI.
Both parties to this action are companies incorporated in Singapore who are in the business of providing third party logistics services. The warehouse was built by SMI on land that it had leased from the Jurong Town Corporation (“JTC”) and has the capacity to store dangerous goods.
In October 2002, the warehouse was occupied by a company called Richland Logistics Pte Ltd (“Richland”) but its lease was due to expire shortly. SMI was therefore interested in finding a new occupant for the warehouse. At the same time, Schenker was trying to obtain a contract from a company called Merck Pte Ltd (“Merck”) to handle its dangerous goods in Singapore. Schenker’s own warehouse did not have enough capacity to receive the Merck goods if the contract was awarded and Schenker was therefore looking to lease some additional warehouse space in Singapore.
