The first plaintiff, Mr Teo Song Kwang alias Richard (“RT”), and the second plaintiff, Seng Hup Realty Pte Ltd (“Seng Hup”), sued the defendant, Mr Vijayasundram Jeyabalan (“VJ”), to recover a large part of the losses incurred by them in a business venture in the Indonesian timber market, on the ground that VJ had a share in the said business venture and had agreed to be liable for the amount claimed by them. In addition, RT, who settled a claim made against him by an Indonesian bank, PT Internationale Nederlanden Indonesia Bank (“ING Bank”), under a guarantee signed by him, VJ, and another party, claimed that VJ was liable for one-third of the settlement sum. VJ denied that he owed any money to RT or Seng Hup.
