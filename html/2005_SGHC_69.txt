These two Registrar’s Appeals, which are basically about whether an order for costs was correctly made, raise a minor but interesting issue about legal practice. The issue is whether it is incorrect practice for one solicitor to ask another to produce his warrant to act.
There is a long backstory to these appeals. Tung Hui Mannequin Industries (hereinafter sometimes “the firm”), the entity named as the plaintiff in this action, was, up to 14 February 2003, a partnership firm in which the partners were one Lu Hui-Huang (“Mr Lu”) and one Udom Kasemkrai (“Mr Udom”). In 1999, the firm commenced High Court Suit No 1777 of 1999 (“Suit 1777”) against Team Wood Decoration & Construction Pte Ltd (hereinafter sometimes “Team Wood”) to recover damages that it had sustained by reason of a fire. In that action, the firm was represented by M/s Gn & Company (“Gn & Co”), who are also its solicitors in the present case.
