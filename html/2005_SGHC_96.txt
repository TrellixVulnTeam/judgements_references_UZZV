This was an application brought by the Law Society of Singapore (“the Law Society”) under s 98(5) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 2001 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) to make absolute an order to show cause which Tay Yong Kwang J had made on 7 April 2005 against the respondent, Fun Huay Yew.
The respondent was called to the Singapore Bar in 1995. At all material times, he carried on practice as a sole proprietor under the style of M/s Fun Huay Yew & Co at 14 Mohamed Sultan Road, #02-02, Singapore 238963. His last known residential address was Block 5 Jurong East Street 32, #10-01, Singapore 609479. The affidavit of service confirmed that all necessary letters and cause papers were sent to both last known addresses. However, they were left unclaimed as the respondent had moved away. Pursuant to the directions of Tay J, the order to show cause was advertised in The Straits Times. The respondent was not present in court on the day this application was heard. Neither was he represented by counsel. No cause was shown and at the conclusion of the hearing we ordered that the respondent be struck off the roll of advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore.
The story began with a claim brought by Toshiba Machine S E Asia Pte Ltd (“Toshiba”) against Reliance Plastic Sdn Bhd (“Reliance”), a Malaysian company, for payment of approximately $1.3m being the purchase price of 11 machines sold to the latter. The respondent was retained as instructing solicitor to work on the claim with a Malaysian law firm, M/s K N Fan & Company. In the course of the proceedings, Toshiba obtained an interim injunction to repossess the 11 machines. By consent of the parties, the 11 machines were sold to a buyer in Singapore. The sale proceeds of $650,000 were held by the respondent as stakeholder pending the outcome of the proceedings in Malaysia. The Malaysian proceedings were eventually settled and Toshiba was to be paid the net sum of $635,000. Initially, Toshiba made no headway in its attempts to secure the release of the $635,000 from the respondent. Finally, on or about 14 February 2003, the respondent handed over a cheque for $635,000 which was post-dated to 5 March 2003. However, the cheque was dishonoured upon presentation for payment on 5 March 2003. Toshiba made a police report against the respondent on 7 March 2003 for misappropriation of the $635,000.
Toshiba also lodged a complaint with the Law Society. A Disciplinary Committee was appointed pursuant to s 90 of the Act to hear and investigate the complaint. The respondent did not appear at the hearing of the Disciplinary Committee. Before the Disciplinary Committee, two charges were preferred against the respondent. They were:
