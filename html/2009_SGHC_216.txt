In order to understand the background to Summons 3938 of 2009 (“the Present Summons”) filed in Originating Summons No 17 of 2008 (“OS 17/2008”), it is necessary to set out the background to OS 17/2008 first. That background is set out in paras 1 to 9 of the Grounds of Decision (“GD”) of Judith Prakash J dated 3 March 2009 for the main action (reported at [2009] 3 SLR 193 ) which I set out below for easy reference.
I should mention that before OS 17/2008 was first heard on 9 October 2008, the seventh and eighth defendants Kailash Nath Rai and Vijay Kumar Rai (the “Remaining Minority”) had filed Summons No 396 of 2008 (“Summons 396/2008) on 28 January 2008 to strike out OS 17/2008 on the ground, inter alia, that the plaintiffs did not have the authority to prosecute OS 17/2008 and that a number of signatories to the collective sale agreement were opposed to OS 17/2008. That summons was heard by Prakash J on 9 October 2008 with OS 17/2008. Prakash J dismissed Summons 396/2008 with costs. Apparently, OS 17/2008 was part-heard and was adjourned to a date to be fixed. On 30 October 2008, Prakash J made her decision on OS 17/2008 (“the 30 October 2008 Order”). She set aside the Board’s order (of 11 December 2007). The costs of OS 17/2008 were to be determined on another date.
I mention Summons 396/2008 because the costs order made therein against the Remaining Minority was one of the reasons why the Present Summons was filed.
After the decision of Prakash J, the Strata Titles Board (the “Board”) recommenced hearing on 18 March 2009. However, by then, the Board had received a letter dated 4 December 2008 from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”) stating that “…the agreement relating to the collective sale of Regent Court has not been stamped”. I will refer to the principal sale agreement as “the SPA”. Apparently there was also a supplemental agreement (see para 6 of Prakash J’s GD). I will refer to that supplemental agreement as “the Supplemental Agreement”. The information about non-stamping was then brought to the attention of the parties by the Board. An attempt thereafter by the parties to settle failed. On 23 March 2009, the Board directed the applicants to pursue a request which the applicants had made earlier, ie, that the purchasers be given a day to stamp the SPA. In the meantime, the parties could also use the time to make a last attempt at settlement. As it turned out, the SPA remained unstamped and there was no settlement. On 24 March 2009, the Board dismissed the application for its approval with each party to bear its own costs. The reason for the dismissal was that it would not be possible for the parties to discharge their respective burdens of proof as each side would have to refer to the SPA and it was not possible to admit the SPA as evidence because it was not stamped.
The plaintiffs then filed Bill of Costs No 137 of 2009 (“BC 137/2009”) in respect of the costs granted to them in Summons 396/2008. The taxation for those costs was scheduled for 28 July 2009. However, on the day before, the Remaining Minority filed the Present Summons. The reliefs sought in the Present Summons were as follows:
The taxation of BC 137/2009 was adjourned to 11 August 2009 pending the hearing of the Present Summons.
The Present Summons came up for hearing on 3 August 2009 together with the outstanding costs issue of OS 17/2008 before Prakash J. She declined to hear the Present Summons as she was of the view that another judge should hear it and adjourned it accordingly. She also made an order that the Present Summons was not to affect the taxation of BC 137/2009. She adjourned the hearing on the issue of costs in respect of OS 17/2008 pending the outcome of the Present Summons.
On 11 August 2008, BC 137/2009 was taxed. Later on the same day, I heard the Present Summons. The other defendants, that is, the first, second, fourth to sixth defendants, and the ninth and tenth defendants in OS 17/2008 took a neutral stand on the Present Summons. After hearing arguments, I adjourned the hearing to 18 August 2009 for the plaintiffs to file an affidavit as to whether they knew that the SPA had not been stamped.
On 13 August 2009, the plaintiffs’ affidavit was filed and served. It stated that they were not aware of the lack of stamping of the SPA (and the Supplemental Agreement) prior to 22 December 2008. That was when their solicitors M/s Legal 21 LLC informed them about a letter from the Board stating that the agreements had not been stamped.
On 18 August 2009, I continued hearing arguments after which I dismissed the Present Summons with costs. The Remaining Minority have filed an appeal to the Court of Appeal against my decision. I set out below the reasons for my decision. I also attach a schedule of a chronology of events for easy reference.
In the first place, prayer 1 of the Present Summons was unnecessary as the Board had already dismissed the application before it on the basis that the SPA, and presumably the Supplemental Agreement as well (collectively “the Relevant Agreements”) were inadmissible in evidence as they were not stamped.
The real reasons for the Present Summons were the costs which the Remaining Minority were liable for under Summons 396/2008 and their potential liability for costs in respect of the 30 October 2008 Order in OS 17/2008.
I will deal with prayers 2 to 3(b) of the Present Summons together as they deal with the 30 October 2008 Order and OS 17/2008.
The thrust of the arguments of Mr Vijay Kumar Rai, who was counsel for the Remaining Minority, as well as being the eighth defendant himself, was that because the Relevant Agreements were not stamped, there was no basis in the first place for the application to be made to the Board. He also argued that for the same reason, ie, the want of stamping, the court had no jurisdiction to make the 30 October 2008 Order. He relied heavily on s 52(1) of the Stamp Duties Act (Cap 312, 2006 Rev Ed). However, the next provision is also relevant. Sections 52(1) and (2) state:
I was of the view that Mr Rai had misapplied s 52(1). It does not render an unstamped document which ought to be stamped void ab initio. It merely stipulates that such a document is not admissible in evidence until the appropriate stamp duty is paid. This is reinforced in s 52(2) which provides for the admissibility of such a document on payment of the stamp duty and any penalty. That rule is a rule of evidence and does not affect the validity of such an unstamped document. As is obvious, the situation could have been rectified at any time upon payment of the appropriate stamp duty and penalty. Furthermore, even if a document were to be invalid in the sense that, for example, it was forged, that does not defeat the jurisdiction of the court to hear and decide on matters based on that document.
It was clear to me that the court had jurisdiction to make the 30 October 2008 Order.
I should also point out that it was because of the 30 October 2008 Order that the Board continued with the hearing of the application and dismissed it (again) for want of stamping. If the 30 October 2008 Order was to be set aside for want of jurisdiction, then the Board’s initial decision of 11 December 2007 would remain. However, if the court did not have jurisdiction to hear OS 17/2008 because of the stamping issue, then it is likely that the Board would also not have jurisdiction to make the decision of 11 December 2007.
Mr Rai, also argued that the 30 October 2008 Order was a fraud upon the Remaining Minority (and the other defendants) because the plaintiffs did not disclose the fact that the Relevant Agreements were not stamped.
Assuming that the plaintiffs were aware of the non-stamping, it is an arguable point whether they were obliged to disclose the non-stamping if no one had asked them about it. In any event, they executed an affidavit to say that they were not aware about the non-stamping as elaborated above. They only knew about the non-stamping after the 30 October 2008 Order had been made. While Mr Rai did not accept their explanation, he himself had no basis for suggesting otherwise beyond his suspicion, frustration and desperation. He was in no position to assert as a fact that they were aware before 30 October 2008.
Mr Low, counsel for the plaintiffs in OS 17/2008, also pointed out that the obligation to pay the stamp duty was on the purchaser and not the vendors. It appeared to me that the purchaser had played the vendors out.
Mr Rai further alleged that the plaintiffs ought to have checked with the purchaser whether the Relevant Agreements had been stamped but Mr Low rightly pointed out that the Remaining Minority (and the other defendants) did not do so themselves. They did not demand to have sight of the original of the Relevant Agreements although they too were represented by solicitors and it was in their interest to do so in the context of the ongoing litigation.
I would also point out that neither the stamping of the Relevant Agreements nor the admissibility thereof was in issue before Prakash J whether in respect of OS 17/2008 or Summons 396/2008.
It was clear to me that there was no fraud on the part of the plaintiffs and, as I have said, the suggestion of the same was without basis.
There was also no injustice arising from the 30 October 2008 Order or from the order made in Summons 396/2008.
I come now to prayer 3(c) of the Present Summons. Under this prayer, the Remaining Minority were asking that the order of 9 October 2008 in respect of Summons 396/2008 be set aside. The Remaining Minority were using the new, but unrelated, information regarding the want of stamping to avoid their liability for costs for Summons 396/2008.
Mr Rai’s arguments for this prayer 3(c) were no different from his arguments for prayers 2 to 3(b) and I reached the same conclusion for prayer 3(c) as for the other prayers.
As a general rule, a litigant is not entitled to set aside earlier costs orders made against him in interlocutory applications even though he succeeds in the main action. There was no reason to depart from the general rule. As mentioned above, I dismissed the Present Summons with costs.
I would add that I was informed by Mr Low that there is apparently now a practice direction that an applicant for approval of a collective sale is to adduce evidence that the relevant sale and purchase agreement is stamped in support of the application.
