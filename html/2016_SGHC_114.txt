Suit 855 of 2014 (“S 855/2014”) arises out of the Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant for damages arising out of alleged breaches of a contract made in 2008 to share profits, as well as for an order for the Plaintiff’s future access to accounts. The parties agreed to have S 855/2014 heard before me as I had heard Suit 844 of 2013 between Virsagi Management (S) Pte Ltd and the current Defendant, involving a similar type of agreement that is at issue in this case. The parties also agreed that my knowledge of the context from the previous case would help to expedite the hearing of this suit.
