The plaintiff’s claim in this suit was dismissed in Lim Geok Lin Andy v Yap Jin Meng Bryan [2016] SGHC 234. Pursuant to my directions in the concluding paragraph of the said judgment dated 21 October 2016, parties filed their submissions on costs.  The Defendant offers to settle these proceedings on a full and final basis on the following terms: 1 The plaintiff will pay 90% of the defendant’s costs on a standard basis until the date of acceptance of this offer, to be agreed or taxed (“the Settlement Costs”). 2 Within seven (7) days of the Defendant receiving the Settlement Costs, the Plaintiff will file a Notice of Discontinuance of this Suit.  Where an offer to settle made by a defendant --- (a) is not withdrawn and has not expired before the disposal of the claim in respect of which the offer to settle is made; and  (b) is not accepted by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff obtains a judgment not more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle, the plaintiff is entitled to his costs on the standard basis to the date the offer was served and the defendant is entitled to costs on an indemnity basis from that date, unless the Court orders otherwise.
