This appeal concerns an application under s 84A of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) by the collective sale committee of an industrial complex known as Citimac Industrial Complex (“Citimac”), which is located at the junction of MacPherson Road and Paya Lebar Road. Citimac comprises 110 units. The appellant owns unit #01-18 on the first level. It was previously a showroom but in 2009, an application was made for change of use to a canteen. The application for change of use was approved and this has not changed to date.
