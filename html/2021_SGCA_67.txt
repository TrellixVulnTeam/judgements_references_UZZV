These grounds concern the latest instalment in the long running feud between Mr Lin Jianwei (“Lin”) and Mdm Tung Yu-Lien Margaret (“Tung”), the only two shareholders and directors of Raffles Town Club Pte Ltd (“RTC”). As we will elaborate upon later, this unfortunate episode takes the form of a tangled and costly procedural mess which serves no one, least of all, RTC. 
By way of a brief overview, CA/SUM 90/2020 (“SUM 90”) and CA/SUM 91/2020 (“SUM 91”) are Tung’s applications to strike out Lin’s Notices of Appeal in CA/CA 137/2020 (“CA 137”) and CA/CA 140/2020 (“CA 140”), respectively. 
CA/OS 42/2020 (“OS 42”) is Lin’s application for leave to appeal against the decision of the High Court judge (“the Judge”) in HC/SUM 3929/2020 (“SUM 3929”) or, in the alternative, leave to appeal against the Judge’s decision in HC/SUM 1281/2020 (“SUM 1281”) and the consequent grant of an extension of time (“EOT”) in respect of such leave. 
CA/SUM 27/2021 (“SUM 27”) is Lin’s application to adduce further evidence in respect of his appeal in CA 137. 
We heard these cross-applications (“Cross Applications”) on 1 April 2021 and allowed SUM 90 and SUM 91 to strike out the Notices of Appeal in CA 137 and CA 140, respectively, as Lin had filed the notices without first obtaining the requisite leave to appeal. In the light of our decision on SUM 91, we dismissed OS 42 which engaged much of the same issues. As for SUM 27, the question of whether leave ought to be given for Lin to adduce further evidence in SUM 27 for the substantive appeal in CA 137 was rendered nugatory in the light of our decision to strike out the Notice of Appeal for CA 137, and we thus dismissed it as well. We ordered Lin to pay Tung a global sum of $40,000 in costs (all-in) in respect of SUM 90, SUM 91, SUM 27 and OS 42. There were to be the usual consequential orders.
We now give the detailed grounds for our decision.
Lin is the Executive Director and Chairman of RTC. He owns 60% of RTC’s shares. Tung is the only other director of RTC and holds the remaining 40% of its shares. RTC did not take an active part in the Cross Applications.
The genesis of the Cross Applications can be traced to HC/OS 1446/2018 (“OS 1446”). This was commenced by Lin on 23 November 2018 to: (a) seek a declaration that one Mr Poon Hon Thang (“Mr Poon”) had been validly appointed as a third director of RTC; or, alternatively, (b) seek an order for the court to convene a shareholders’ Extraordinary General Meeting (“EGM”) to effect Mr Poon’s appointment. By way of her reply affidavit dated 18 January 2019, Tung counterclaimed in OS 1446 for orders and declarations that several notices of EGMs and the decisions taken at those EGMs, as well as several notices of board of directors’ meetings and the decisions made at those meetings, were invalid and of no effect. 
On 11 October 2019, Lin withdrew his claims in OS 1446, leaving only Tung’s counterclaims. OS 1446 is stayed pending the outcome of HC/S 1048/2018 – a suit between Lin and Tung concerning the transfer of shares in RTC and its related companies, as well as certain sums owed between them in relation to RTC’s affairs.
A slew of related disputes subsequently arose between Tung and Lin, which resulted in a flurry of applications being filed in court. Unsurprisingly, the parties’ dispute in OS 1446 spawned a tangled procedural tapestry. Before laying out the chronology of these related disputes, it is helpful to provide a map of this tapestry.
