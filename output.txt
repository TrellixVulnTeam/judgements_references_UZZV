4: (17 of the MDA, 'Once the above is satisfied, s 17 of the MDA then comes into operation, creating a presumption that the accused was in possession of the offensive substances for the purpose of trafficking in them.')
 ----------
5: (17 of the MDA, 'The question of possession The first issue which needed to be determined in this appeal therefore was the question of whether or not the prosecution had even succeeded in proving that the appellant was in possession of the opium at the time of her arrest, for, as mentioned earlier, possession of the drugs must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt before the presumption in s 17 of the MDA may be relied upon.')
 ----------
6: (5(1)(a) of the MDA, 'It is further pertinent at this stage to point out that even if the appellant was unaware that opium would be delivered to her and that she intended upon their discovery to return the drugs back to Henry Tan when the opportunity arose, this alone is sufficient to constitute the offence of trafficking under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA.')
