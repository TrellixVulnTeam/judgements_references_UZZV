 ----------
83: (2 of the LPA, 'The court further noted that s 2 of the LPA defined “Judge” as “a Judge of the High Court sitting in chambers”, but it considered that this definition was not apt because there was no requirement that an application under s 96 had to be heard in chambers.')

88: (two assumptions in Hilborne (PC, 'It identified two assumptions in Hilborne (PC) – that disciplinary proceedings were civil proceedings and that the absence of a provision excluding an appeal could give rise to a right of appeal by implication.')
 ----------
89: (LPA, 'These assumptions were thought to be flawed because disciplinary actions under the LPA were not civil actions, and a right of appeal had to be expressly provided for (Top Ten Entertainment at [49]).')
 ----------
90: (LPA, 'The court concluded by considering the historical development of the legislative framework governing the disciplinary process and observed that the passing of separate legislation (being the LPA and SCJA) reinforced the separation of disciplinary proceedings from the normal civil process (Top Ten Entertainment at [71]).')
 ----------
91: (97 of the LPA, 'In our judgment, though Top Ten Entertainment clearly states that there is no right of appeal against a decision of a Judge pursuant to ss 95, 96 and 97 of the LPA, the fact that the specific question of jurisdiction does not appear to have been fully argued, and the fact that the real question at issue in that case had nothing to do with the public interest in investigating the conduct of a solicitor, cause us to reconsider the correctness of the observations that were made on jurisdiction.')

98: (LPA, 'Second, the oversight of disciplinary proceedings under the LPA was not an exercise of civil or criminal jurisdiction, but an exercise of a unique disciplinary jurisdiction by a specially constituted court (Re Nalpon Zero at [67]).')

108: (3] supra) was that the definition set out in the LPA, 'A key element of the decision in Top Ten Entertainment ([3] supra) was that the definition set out in the LPA was not appropriate, and the more appropriate definition was in s 2 of the Interpretation Act, which at that time referred to “a Judge of the High Court and includes any person appointed to exercise the powers of a Judge“ (Top Ten Entertainment at [45]). With the greatest respect, we consider this aspect of the court’s reasoning unpersuasive. Where a word has been defined in the relevant statute, there is no reason to have recourse instead to the Interpretation Act unless “there is something in the subject or context inconsistent with such construction or unless it is therein otherwise expressly provided” (see s 2(1) of the Interpretation Act).')

 ----------
111: (97 of the LPA, 'Further and in any case, although the court in Top Ten Entertainment preferred the definition in s 2 of the Interpretation Act, it nonetheless held that a Judge under ss 95, 96 and 97 of the LPA was “a judge of the High Court exercising disciplinary jurisdiction under Pt VII of the LPA” [emphasis added] (Top Ten Entertainment at [45]).')
 ----------
112: (Interpretation Act, 'Hence, its recourse to the Interpretation Act did not displace the definition of a Judge as one of the High Court.')
 ----------
113: (96 had to be heard in chambers, and it inferred that the definition of a “Judge” in the LPA, 'The court in Top Ten Entertainment seemed to have been influenced by the fact that there was no requirement that an application under s 96 had to be heard in chambers, and it inferred that the definition of a “Judge” in the LPA was confined to provisions other than those in Part VII.')

114: (32(3) of the LPA, 'Yet none of the other provisions cited (being ss 22, 23, 25B, 25C, 27A, 27B, 28 and 32(3) of the LPA in force at the time) explicitly require that the matters they concern must be heard in chambers.')
 ----------
115: (2 of the LPA, 'In the latter case, it seems clear that on the plain meaning of the definition of “court” in s 2 of the LPA that this would be a hearing before the High Court; and it cannot then be sensibly contended that if a Judge were to hear the matter in chambers, she would be sitting in some other capacity than as a Judge of the High Court.')
 ----------
116: (2 of the Interpretation Act, 'Furthermore, the court’s recourse to s 2 of the Interpretation Act gave rise to some inconsistency with the rest of the LPA and, indeed, within Part VII.')
 ----------
117: (2 of the LPA, 'To begin, it should be noted that the definition of a “Judge” as one sitting in chambers becomes wholly unremarkable when it is seen in light of the fact that s 2 of the LPA also defines “court” as “the High Court or a Judge when sitting in open court”.')
