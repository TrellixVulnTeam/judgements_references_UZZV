69: (397(1) of the CPC, 'As mentioned at the start of this judgment, this CM is an application for leave under s 397(1) of the CPC to refer to the Court of Appeal the following four questions of law that are said to have arisen from the Judge’s decision: Question 1:  Where an accused persons faces an amended charge at the conclusion of trial, should the accused person be permitted, as a matter of natural justice and procedural fairness, to call Defence witnesses to give evidence on his behalf in respect of the amended charge as he would be entitled to in a situation where the charge was not amended?')

72: (283 of the CPC, 'It appeared to us that the answer was to be found in Question 4 and ultimately, how s 283 of the CPC (which facilitates the calling of additional witnesses post-amendment) is construed in relation to s 131 of the CPC (which lays down a right to recall witnesses “[i]f a charge is altered or a new charge is framed by the court after the start of a trial”).')
 ----------
73: (131 of the CPC, 'With this in mind, we decided that Question 4, which concerns the threshold for the court’s exercise of discretion under s 283(1), should be reformulated and we proposed to the parties the following reformulated Question 4 at the hearing: Where an application is made by an accused person to call fresh evidence to answer an amended charge in circumstances where the charge is amended after the defence has been called, should such an application generally be dealt with on the same basis as would an application under s 131 of the CPC?')
 ----------
74: (47(6) Passports Act, 'The first issue concerned the consequential orders that should follow in the event we decided that additional evidence ought to have been allowed, that such additional evidence was likely to be material and that therefore the conviction on the amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge ought to be set aside.')

75: (Immigration Act, 'The second issue was the effect that any decision on the first issue would have on the Immigration Act charges as these were not the subject of this CM.')
 ----------
76: (Immigration Act, 'We opined provisionally that the only matter in the Immigration Act charges that might be affected would be the sentencing because the sentencing for both sets of charges for the two Acts was considered as a whole.')

 ----------
81: (397 of the CPC, 'It is therefore not a question of law within the ambit of s 397 of the CPC.')
 ----------
82: (230 of the CPC, 'As for Question 3, contrary to the applicant’s submissions, there is nothing in the structure of s 230 of the CPC to suggest that it is intended to operate in such a way that there is a reset of the entire process (in the sense that the Defence has to start all over again from the beginning) once the charge is amended at the close of the Defence’s case.')
 ----------
83: (47 of the Passports Act, 'The amendment by the DJ here was substantive because it involved a new offence, although both offences appear within s 47 of the Passports Act and both have the same punishment provisions.')

 ----------
85: (283 of the CPC, 'On this analysis, when the DJ was dealing with the Defence’s application to call Mr Tsai and Mr Huang pursuant to s 283 of the CPC, instead of considering only the question whether these intended defence witnesses were essential under s 283(2), the DJ should also have considered the court’s general discretion under s 283(1) read with s 131 of the CPC.')
 ----------
86: (Passports Act, 'Further, we think that she should have exercised the court’s general discretion in favour of the applicant in order to safeguard his right to adduce all relevant evidence in his defence to the amended charge which, as we have emphasised, was amended only at the tail end of the trial and which involved a different offence under the Passports Act.')
 ----------
87: (283(1) CPC, 'The Judge added that although the DJ’s reasoning was correct in relation to whether the intended evidence was “essential to making a just decision in the case” under s 283(2), she felt that the DJ “did not fully appreciate the need to also consider whether the relevance of Mr Huang and Mr Tsai’s evidence would nonetheless justify her exercising her general discretion under s 283(1) CPC to allow them to be called”.')
 ----------
88: (283(1) of the CPC, 'Nevertheless, the Judge decided to confine her decision to the issue in s 283(2) as the issue in s 283(1) of the CPC was not the ground relied on in the appeal before her (HC GD at [129]).')

89: (397 of the CPC, 'The only question that remains is whether the new Question 4 also satisfies the fourth condition of s 397 of the CPC set out in Lam Leng Hung.')

90: (47(6) Passports Act, 'It was contended that this additional evidence would have been critical to the mens rea of the amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge.')
 ----------
91: (169 of the Evidence Act, 'In reaching this conclusion she relied on s 169 of the Evidence Act (HC GD at [130]) which provides that:  No new trial for improper admission or rejection of evidence 169.')
 ----------
92: (131 of the CPC, 'It seems to us ironic and illogical that if the original s 47(3) Passports Act charges had been amended to charges under s 47(6) of the Passports Act immediately after the start of the trial or even at the close of the Prosecution’s case, the Defence would have the liberty to call any witnesses it wishes (subject to the condition in s 131 of the CPC that the calling of such witnesses is not frivolous or vexatious or is not meant to cause delay or to frustrate justice) but if the charges were amended practically at the end of the trial, the accused person should be confined to calling or recalling witnesses whose evidence is “essential to making a just decision in the case” under s 283(2) of the CPC.')
 ----------
93: (47(6) Passports Act, 'The Prosecution also submitted that the applicant’s evidence should be accorded primary importance because the amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge pertains to his own mental state.')
 ----------
94: (47(6) Passports Act, 'However, we think that it may not be fair to rely exclusively on the applicant’s existing evidence on record to make out the amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge.')
 ----------
95: (47(3) Passports Act, 'As pointed out earlier, the Judge rationalised the DJ’s amendment of the s 47(3) Passports Act charges on the basis that the distinction between the s 47(3) offence and the s 47(6) offence was “fairly narrow”.')
 ----------
96: (2(1) of the Passports Act, 'A “foreign travel document” is defined in s 2(1) of the Passports Act as one that is issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country while s 2(3) of the same Act defines a “false foreign travel document” as one that is not issued by or on behalf of the government of a foreign country or a “foreign travel document” that has been altered by a person who is not authorised to alter that document.')
 ----------
97: (47(3) Passports Act, 'In amending the s 47(3) Passports Act charges to the s 47(6) Passports Act charges, the DJ explained that the facts showed that the applicant had obtained the Passport through dubious means and that looking at the entire factual matrix under which he obtained the Passport and the Passport itself, everything pointed inexorably to the fact that the Passport was “false, bogus, fraudulent” and was, in short, not a legitimate one.')
 ----------
98: (47(3) Passports Act, 'Second, the s 47(3) Passports Act charges involved a different mens rea from that in the s 47(6) Passports Act charges.')
 ----------
99: (47(3) Passports Act, 'The s 47(3) Passports Act charges alleged that the applicant “knew” that the (genuine) foreign travel document was not issued to him.')
 ----------
100: (47(6) Passports Act, 'However, in the s 47(6) Passports Act charges framed by the DJ, this was altered to “ought reasonably to have known” that the document was a false foreign travel document, which is constructive knowledge.')
 ----------
101: (47(6) Passports Act, 'DPP Faizal conceded fairly that the Prosecution did not put to the applicant an alternative case based on the s 47(6) Passports Act charges.')

102: (47(3) Passports Act, 'We therefore disagree with the Judge’s view that the applicant’s evidence formed a “single unified defence” against the s 47(3) Passports Act charges and the s 47(6) Passports Act charges (HC GD at [86]).')

 ----------
104: (Passports Act, 'He could not have anticipated during his testimony that the charges against him would be altered to specify a different offence under the Passports Act.')
 ----------
105: (47(6) Passports Act, 'Accordingly, we think that it would not be safe or fair to convict the applicant on the s 47(6) Passports Act charges or the single amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge without hearing the evidence of his two defence witnesses.')
 ----------
106: (47(3) Passports Act, 'However, similar to the applicant’s oral testimony, his statements were made in response to the original s 47(3) Passports Act charges.')
 ----------
107: (47(3) Passports Act, 'As we have explained earlier, the original s 47(3) Passports Act charges proceeded on the basis that the Passport was genuine.')

108: (47(3) Passports Act, 'The answer would appear to be similar to the earlier discussions regarding the differences between the s 47(3) Passports Act charges and the s 47(6) Passports Act charges.')

109: (2(3) of the Passports Act, 'The Passport would therefore fall within the meaning of a “false foreign travel document” as defined in s 2(3) of the Passports Act.')
 ----------
110: (47(3) Passports Act, 'This meant that the Prosecution would not be able to prove the s 47(3) Passports Act charges because they were premised on the Passport being a genuine foreign travel document.')
 ----------
111: (47(3) Passports Act, 'From the above discussions, although the applicant’s evidence at the trial raised questions, the DJ did not apply the correct legal principles when she refused to grant the applicant’s application to call his two defence witnesses after she amended the s 47(3) Passports Act charges to the s 47(6) Passports Act charges.')
 ----------
112: (283(1) of the CPC, 'The Judge’s affirmation of the DJ’s refusal was correspondingly incorrect although the Judge did proceed to discuss the proper legal principles pertaining to this case but she decided not to intervene in the DJ’s decision on the ground that the applicant’s appeal in the High Court was premised on only s 283(2) and not s 283(1) of the CPC.')

113: (131 of the CPC, 'The correct approach in the circumstances of this case is to consider the applicant’s application to call Mr Tsai and Mr Huang according to the tenets in ss 283(1) and 283(2) read with s 131 of the CPC.')

114: (47(6) Passports Act, 'It is not possible at this stage to say that these two witnesses’ evidence would not be relevant to the amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge (as acknowledged by the Judge at [129] of the HC GD).')
 ----------

 ----------
116: (131 of the CPC, 'Our answer to the new Question 4 is therefore: Yes, where an application is made by an accused person to call fresh evidence to answer an amended charge in circumstances where the charge is amended after the defence has been called, such an application should generally be dealt with on the same basis as would an application under s 131 of the CPC.')

 ----------
119: (47(6) Passports Act, 'The parties filed their further submissions to address us on this point in greater detail as well as on the issue of whether a decision to set aside the applicant’s conviction on the amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge will affect his conviction on the Immigration Act charges.')

121: (47(6) Passports Act, 'The applicant disagrees and submits that he should be acquitted on the amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge.')

122: (2(3) of the Passports Act, 'The Prosecution failed to specify what type of false foreign travel document the Passport was, that is, whether it was a fabricated document or a tampered one (see the definition in s 2(3) of the Passports Act).')
 ----------
123: (47(6) Passports Act, 'Given this lack of particularity, a retrial on the amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge would be prejudicial.')
 ----------
124: (47(6) Passports Act, 'In our view, considering the fact that the Defence’s application to call two witnesses to present evidence in answer to the 46 s 47(6) Passports Act charges after they were amended very late during the trial was refused on wrong principles and the fact that we are unable to say that such evidence will not be relevant or not material to those charges or to the single amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge in the High Court, we are of the view that the conviction on the amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge should not be allowed to stand.')
 ----------
125: (47(6) Passports Act, 'We also think that a retrial for the amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge would be the best solution in the circumstances, bearing in mind the overall course of the trial (which the Judge described as “fairly eventful” in the HC GD at [2]).')
 ----------
126: (392 of the CPC, 'It would not be ideal to have the Judge hear Mr Tsai’s and Mr Huang’s evidence under s 392 of the CPC as she was not the trial judge.')
 ----------
127: (47(6) Passports Act, 'Since the DJ is no longer with the State Courts, it would also not be ideal to have another DJ continue with the trial and hear only the two witnesses’ evidence on the amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge.')
 ----------
128: (47(3) Passports Act, 'Further, as noted earlier, until the charges were amended after the close of the Defence’s case, all evidence led by both parties was in relation to the s 47(3) Passports Act charges (although some Prosecution witnesses were recalled after the amendment) and we have pointed out that there are material differences between an offence under s 47(3) and one under s 47(6).')

131: (2(3) of the Passports Act, 'On this point, we think it would be fair for the Prosecution to specify which limb of the definition of “false foreign travel document” in s 2(3) of the Passports Act it will be relying on.')
 ----------
132: (47(6) Passports Act, 'The question related to ordering a retrial is whether the Prosecution should be allowed to proceed with only the amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge or whether it is at liberty to prefer any charge(s) that it deems appropriate.')
 ----------
133: (47(6) Passports Act, 'The applicant submits that any retrial regarding the Passport should be confined to the amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge because if it were otherwise, the Prosecution would be given another chance to prosecute him anew.')
 ----------
134: (47(7) of the Passports Act, 'If, for instance, the Prosecution now prefers a s 47(1) charge, the applicant would be deprived of the defence of reasonable excuse in s 47(7) of the Passports Act because s 47(7) applies only to offences under ss 47(2) – 47(6).')
 ----------
135: (47(3) Passports Act, 'It will also be recalled that the amendment of the s 47(3) Passports Act charges to those under s 47(6) was not even the Prosecution’s proposal at the trial.')
 ----------
136: (47(7) of the Passports Act, 'In respect of the applicant’s objection on the ground that he may lose the benefit of the defence in s 47(7) of the Passports Act should the Prosecution now decide to proceed with a s 47(1) charge, the applicant appears to have overlooked the fact that if the Prosecution does so, it takes upon itself to prove the mens rea of dishonesty on the part of the applicant because that is a requirement under s 47(1).')
 ----------
137: (Immigration Act, 'Turning to the second issue relating to the Immigration Act charges, the applicant submits that setting aside the conviction on the amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge will justify a reconsideration of his sentences for the Immigration Act charges.')
 ----------
138: (Immigration Act, 'In the applicant’s words, “[f]or fairness and consistency, the findings made after any retrial must be considered when considering the appropriate sentence under the Immigration Act charges”.')
 ----------
139: (Immigration Act, 'The Prosecution points out that while the applicant accepts that he is guilty on the Immigration Act charges, he contends that the sentences for those charges should be reconsidered should Mr Tsai and Mr Huang’s evidence be taken.')
 ----------
140: (47(6) Passports Act, 'It asks, if the two witnesses’ advanced age has caused their memory to fade in respect of the amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge, why their evidence would then shed light on the applicant’s culpability in respect of other charges.')
 ----------
141: (Immigration Act, 'First, we are of the view that there is no need to set aside the applicant’s conviction in respect of the Immigration Act charges although the conviction on the amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge has been set aside.')
 ----------
142: (Immigration Act, 'The Immigration Act charges were concerned with the declaration of information by the applicant in his disembarkation forms and this is separate from the issues pertaining to the amended s 47(6) Passports Act charge.')
 ----------
143: (Immigration Act, 'Further, the applicant did not appeal against his conviction in respect of the Immigration Act charges.')
 ----------
144: (Immigration Act, 'The conviction on the Immigration Act charges therefore stand.')
 ----------
145: (Immigration Act, 'However, in respect of the sentences for the Immigration Act charges, as altered on appeal by the Judge, we think they should be set aside and that the sentencing for those charges should be reserved for the new trial judge to decide after the retrial.')

146: (Immigration Act, 'We also do not know how the evidence from the Prosecution and the Defence will pan out at the retrial, whether such evidence will impact the applicant’s culpability in the Immigration Act charges in some way and what conclusions will be reached by the new trial judge.')
 ----------
147: (Immigration Act, 'Further, in the event of a conviction on the charge(s) that the Prosecution may prefer at the retrial, the new trial judge will have to look at all the circumstances in deciding the appropriate individual as well as the collective sentences for the different types of offences, bearing in mind that there will be consecutive imprisonment terms in view of the number of Immigration Act charges if imprisonment is considered the appropriate sentence for all the charges.')
 ----------
148: (Immigration Act, 'We therefore set aside the sentences for the Immigration Act charges and reserve sentencing on those charges to the new trial judge.')

149: (131 of the CPC, '(b) We answer the new Question 4 affirmatively and hold, applying the principles in s 131 of the CPC, that the applicant should have been allowed to call Mr Tsai and Mr Huang as his witnesses after the s 47(3) Passports Act charges were amended to allege a different offence after the close of the case for the Defence.')

142: (4(6) of the AA, 'While the broad view would also satisfy the purpose of s 4(6) of the AA, insofar as it would also prevent a party from resiling from an agreement on the basis of formal invalidity, it does so with a number of additional implications which were not intended by Parliament.')
